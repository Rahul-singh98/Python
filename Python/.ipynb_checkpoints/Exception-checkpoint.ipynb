    "# NZEC error in Python\n",
    "    While coding in various competitive sites, many people must have have encountered NZEC error. NZEC (non zero exit code) as the name suggests occurs when your code is failed to return 0. When a code returns 0 it means it is successfully executed otherwise it will return some other number depending on the type of error.\n",
