    "    In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding."

    "    It is also possible to create a function that can take any object, allowing for polymorphism. In this example, let’s create a function called “func()” which will take an object which we will name “obj”. Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be able to be called into this function. Next, lets give the function something to do that uses the ‘obj’ object we passed to it. In this case lets call the three methods, viz., capital(), language() and type(), each of which is defined in the two classes ‘India’ and ‘USA’. Next, let’s create instantiations of both the ‘India’ and ‘USA’ classes if we don’t have them already. With those, we can call their action using the same func() function:"
